              \paragraph{That cartoon frog is more sinister than you might realize} Donald Trump is not a traditional republicans and does not have the the traditional republican base behind him. The ‘Alt-Right’ is a big part of his constituency - a newly formed group that resides strongly on 4Chan and r/The\_Donald on Reddit. They are the group that falls into what Hillary Clinton labeled the ‘Basket of Deplorables’. They participate in brigading, hacking, and their group has expanded to include Neo-Nazis and other hate groups. They, especially those on r/The\_Donald and 4Chan’s /pol, use an internet meme called Pepe. Pepe is an old comic that the original creator has disowned and recognized as a hate symbol. Many other groups have also officially recognized Pepe as a hate symbol, too. Donald Trump and his son, who has actively re-shared these comics of his father and Pepe, sometimes together, have both denied that this is white supremacy, but those who publicly identify as white supremacists, such as David Duke, have taken ownership of this cartoon.\\
              \\Pepe was not originally a hate symbol and is not only a hate symbol today. It can be used with good intentions and without the purpose of white supremacy. That being said, it is close to the symbol of the Swastika. It was not originally a hate symbol and can be used as a symbol of divine power today, but its use has been hijacked by Nazis. Pepe and the Swastika are similar in that way, and when one sees Pepe today, there is a high probability that it is in fact supporting white supremacy.

              \paragraph{She also admitted she was `kind of far removed' from the middle class} Clinton has been the target of many hackers this election. In fact, Donald Trump is on record encouraging the Russians to hack her emails. He and his base rejoice whenever WikiLeaks releases another pile of information. This time, they have released transcripts of her speeches that she gave to the big banks on Wall Street. She later confirmed that this is is true: she said that it is important for a politician to have a public and private policy. She explained that it has been useful to some of the greats, such as Abraham Lincoln, who relied on white lies and deception to free the slaves.

              \paragraph{Trump also said no one has more respect for women than him} Donald Trump cannot keep his mouth shut for the life of him. He has had no qualms about interrupting Hillary in debates, starting in the first debate. He interjected “wrong” and other words when Hillary was trying to speak. In the last debate, Trump interrupted and took Clinton’s bait when she called him a puppet of Russia. When she was talking about him and trying to bait him again, he leans into the microphone and says, “Such a nasty woman”. The live audience audibly gasped. This just gives Clinton’s claim that he doesn’t respect women more evidence, and he is unable to realize that he is only hurting himself.

              \paragraph{Comey: FBI has not changed conclusions on Clinton} The FBI has finished going through emails from Clinton that they obtained from former Representative Anthony Weiner’s devices. It turns out that they already had all of the emails and the ones that they didn’t were personal. Donald Trump and his supporters are outraged, although more mainstream Republicans have already seen the records and agree that no charges could be brought against her. She has been tried many times by Republicans seeking to remove her from power. She has been cleared of any wrongdoing in the Benghazi mess eight times, and now twice for her emails. The chants of lock her up are misinformed, as much of this election has been. Recently, SNL’s Alec Baldwin said (of Trump about the truth), “[The truth] doesn’t matter. I’ve said it and now half the country believes it.”

              \vskip4cm
              \paragraph{Why Fourier?} Fourier allows us to generate a function of sines and cosines to approximate another function. In this case, the function that we are approximating
              is the result of the election, the expected polls. Fourier also allows us to have known turning points (points of inflection), which are to be expected day to day and correspond
              with the news cycle and new things coming out about the candidates. The numbers I used are from fivethirtyeight.com. They allow you to download a .csv file with all of the polls they
              analyzed and adjusted. I used the FiveThirtyEight adjusted data.

              \paragraph{Poll Analysis} At these sample times, Clinton has remained pretty steady. Trump fell off and rose again, as was characteristic of his campaign and the
              things that he has said. Johnson saw a large drop in support in these FiveThirtyEight polls, and ``other'' meaning disaffected voters and Stein supporters saw a rise.
              It is interesting that all of these polls have Clinton winning. She did win the popular vote, but the electoral college was a surprise. All of these three polls had her
              winning Wisconsin, too, something that did not occur.

              }
              \paragraph{Analysis} One of the scariest parts about this election has been the fear about Trump not accepting Clinton as the winner if she won. It would be more than
              detrimental to our democracy, it could potentially incite violence. With half the country by his side, damage would surely have been done. It's not on our minds anymore
              now that he won, but had he lost, there would be much larger riots and probably violence (from looking at his rallies). The cartoon here paints Trump at the signing of
              our Constitution, complaining about how the system that they designed hundreds of years ago is rigged against him. Unfortunately, the cartoon doesn't need to look any
              farther than Trump's own words to make it seem outlandish.

              \subsection{Clinton, Feingold, and Pocan. Not for Party, but for Competence.}
              The Republicans this year have not chosen the greatest candidates. Clinton has her flaws, but Trump is clearly unfit to be president.
              He has multiple laundry lists of faults and has shown that he will never have America’s interests at heart.
              Clinton is harassed by Republicans about Benghazi and her emails, which have both been investigated multiple times with no finding of wrongdoing.
              She is the clear choice because her opponent would be damaging.
              For Feingold, he could not push through an incredibly liberal agenda as Republicans would still be a strong force, but he would be an extra voice for climate change action,
              something that we need to enact immediately. Pocan is better than his opponent Theron because he has shown that he can work across the aisle and has a political personality,
              while Theron seems incapable of forming a logical argument.\\\vskip2cm

              \paragraph{To President Trump} To Mr. Trump: I did not vote for you. Yet, as you said, you will be my President. I want you to keep in mind that just because people voted
              you into office, that does not mean the country wants 100\% of your policies. I personally find some of yours destructive, particularly your view on climate change. Please,
              I implore you, listen to your country. Remember that you are supposed to represent the American people, and you need to put aside personal convictions to listen to the people.
              Climate change is the largest issue for me. Listen to the people who have devoted their lives to the cause of climate study. It is inconvenient, but much of the things you will
              be required to do as President will not be convenient, not in the slightest. Now is the time to stand up for our children, and our children's children, and I expect you, as our
              President, to stand with the majority of the population.
